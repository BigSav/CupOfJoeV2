		<span class="firstL">J</span>oe was born in San Fransisco, California and has lived there all his life. He has two older sisters. He went to the Menlow School in California before transferring as a new junior to <a class="textLink" href="https://www.stmarksschool.org/">St. Mark's School</a> this year. The warm and sunny weather of California is what Joe misses the most as Massachussets is too cold for him during the harsh winter. He plays varsity basketball at St. Mark's School and is also the roommate of Mr. Savage.
